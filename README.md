# Hello-World
I've been teaching myself how to become a full stack developer the past couple of months. I am hoping to gain working knowledge of front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back end (Java, C#, .Net) programming languages by December. My new year resolution (yay!) is to secure my first programming job by January 2018!

Wish me luck!
